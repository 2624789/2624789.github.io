DIY anonymous offline file-sharing and communications system built with free software and inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware.

PirateBox creates offline wireless networks designed for anonymous file sharing, chatting, message boarding, and media streaming. You can think of it as your very own portable offline Internet in a box! 

When users join the PirateBox wireless network and open a web browser, they are automatically redirected to the PirateBox welcome page. Users can anonymously chat, post images or comments on the bulletin board, watch or listen to streaming media, or upload and download files inside their web browser. 
Our current target hardware is the TP-Link TL-MR3020 and TP-Link TL-MR3040 wireless routers and the Raspberry Pi single board computer. You should be able to pick up each of these devices for around US$35. Visit the PirateBox OpenWrt DIY page and the Raspberry Pi page for detailed instructions and more info.

PirateBox is designed to be private and secure. No logins are required and no user data is logged. Users remain anonymous â€“ the system is purposely not connected to the Internet in order to subvert tracking and preserve user privacy.
